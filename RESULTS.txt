HASHIRA PLACEMENTS ASSIGNMENT - FINAL RESULTS
==============================================

SOLUTION SUMMARY:
- Language: Java
- Algorithm: Shamir's Secret Sharing with Lagrange Interpolation
- Purpose: Find the constant term (secret) of polynomial from encoded points

RESULTS:
--------

TEST CASE 1 (roots.json):
- n = 4, k = 3 (quadratic polynomial)
- SECRET (CONSTANT TERM): 3

TEST CASE 2 (testcase2.json):
- n = 10, k = 7 (degree 6 polynomial)  
- SECRET (CONSTANT TERM): -6290016743746469796

VERIFICATION:
- Both solutions verified against remaining points
- All calculations use BigInteger for precision
- Base conversions handled correctly for all bases (2-16)

MATHEMATICAL APPROACH:
1. Parse JSON to extract points with different bases
2. Convert all y-values from their respective bases to decimal
3. Use Lagrange interpolation to find f(0) = constant term
4. Formula: f(0) = Σ(yi × Li(0)) where Li(0) = Π((0-xj)/(xi-xj))
